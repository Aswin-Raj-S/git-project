# AI Model Risk Scoring System Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the AI model risk assessment system to provide more accurate and dynamic scoring based on actual model characteristics and detected threats.

## Problems Addressed

### 1. Hardcoded Scores
- **Before**: Trust indicators used fixed scores (85%, 45%, 72%, 30%) regardless of actual analysis results
- **After**: Dynamic scoring based on real threat detection and model analysis

### 2. Oversimplified Risk Calculation
- **Before**: Basic algorithm with limited threat weighting
- **After**: Sophisticated weighted scoring considering severity levels and threat types

### 3. Poor Risk-to-Score Correlation
- **Before**: Scores often showed "high trust" even when threats were detected
- **After**: Accurate correlation between detected risks and displayed scores

## Key Improvements

### 1. Dynamic Trust Scoring (`/src/lib/risk-scoring.ts`)

#### File Integrity Scoring
- **SafeTensors Format**: Bonus points for secure serialization
- **Pickle Detection**: Heavy penalties for dangerous deserialization formats
- **Malware Status Impact**: 
  - Clean: No penalty
  - Suspicious: 8-30 point penalty based on threat count
  - Infected: 15-60 point penalty based on severity

#### Model Provenance Scoring
- **Author Information**: +25 points if available, -15 if missing
- **Version Control**: +15 points for version info, -10 if missing
- **Framework Detection**: +10 points for known frameworks

#### Security Profile Scoring
- **Architecture Analysis**: -30 points for suspicious structures
- **Security Issues**: Up to -45 points based on issue count and severity
- **Parameter Analysis**: Risk assessment based on model size

#### Community Trust Scoring
- **Format Preference**: Bonus for community-preferred formats
- **Framework Ecosystem**: Higher scores for established frameworks
- **Transparency**: Penalties for anonymous or suspicious models

### 2. Enhanced Risk Calculation (`/src/app/api/analyze/route.ts`)

#### Improved Malware Scoring (0-70 points)
```typescript
// Severity-based scoring
Critical: 70 points
High: 55 points  
Medium: 40 points
Low: 25 points

// Additional pattern penalties
Critical patterns (eval, exec, subprocess): +15 points
High-risk patterns (pickle, obfuscation): +8 points
```

#### Architecture Risk Assessment (0-25 points)
- Suspicious architecture: +20 points
- Pickle format: +25 points (extremely dangerous)
- Non-SafeTensors PyTorch: +15 points
- Security issues: Up to +20 points based on severity

#### Model Size Risk (0-10 points)
- Extremely large models (>175B): +10 points
- Large models (>100B): +7 points
- Medium models (>10B): +4 points
- Suspiciously small models: +5 points

### 3. UI Component Updates

#### Trust Card (`/src/components/report/trust-card.tsx`)
- **Real-time Analysis**: Uses actual analysis data instead of hardcoded values
- **Risk Factor Display**: Shows specific risk factors for each category
- **Dynamic Recommendations**: Security recommendations based on actual threats
- **Contextual Badges**: Dynamic verification badges reflecting real status

#### Summary Card (`/src/components/report/summary-card.tsx`)
- **5-Level Risk Scale**: More granular risk assessment
  - Minimal Risk (0-14): Green - Safe for production
  - Low Risk (15-29): Yellow - Minor concerns
  - Medium Risk (30-49): Amber - Moderate validation needed
  - High Risk (50-69): Red - Significant security risks
  - Critical Risk (70-100): Dark Red - Do not use

### 4. Weighted Overall Scoring

The overall trust score uses weighted averages:
- **File Integrity**: 35% weight
- **Security Profile**: 35% weight  
- **Model Provenance**: 20% weight
- **Community Trust**: 10% weight

This ensures that actual security concerns have the highest impact on the final score.

## Results

### Before vs After Comparison

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Score Accuracy | Fixed, unrealistic scores | Dynamic, threat-based scores |
| Risk Correlation | Poor correlation with actual risks | Strong correlation with detected threats |
| Threat Response | Ignored actual threats | Responds to severity and count |
| User Understanding | Misleading high trust scores | Clear risk levels with explanations |
| Security Value | Limited practical value | Actionable security intelligence |

### Validation Results

Testing with existing model files shows:
- **Risk Scores**: Now range from 36-55 based on actual threats
- **Threat Detection**: Properly identifies and weighs suspicious patterns
- **Format Assessment**: Correctly assesses SafeTensors vs other formats
- **Dynamic Updates**: Scores change based on analysis results

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. `/src/lib/risk-scoring.ts` - New dynamic scoring algorithm
2. `/src/components/report/trust-card.tsx` - Updated to use real data
3. `/src/components/report/summary-card.tsx` - Improved risk level descriptions
4. `/src/app/api/analyze/route.ts` - Enhanced risk calculation

### Key Functions
- `calculateTrustScores()` - Main scoring algorithm
- `getRiskLevel()` - Risk level determination
- `calculateRiskScore()` - Enhanced API risk calculation

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Threat-Weighted Scoring**: Higher penalties for more dangerous threats
2. **Format-Specific Assessment**: Different risk profiles for different model formats
3. **Severity Consideration**: Malware severity levels properly weighted
4. **User-Friendly Display**: Clear risk levels with actionable descriptions
5. **Real-time Updates**: Scores update based on actual analysis results

## Future Enhancements

1. **Community Integration**: Connect with model repositories for community trust data
2. **Machine Learning**: Use ML to improve threat pattern detection
3. **Historical Analysis**: Track model behavior over time
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare models against known safe/unsafe examples

## Conclusion

The improved scoring system provides accurate, actionable security intelligence based on real threat analysis rather than arbitrary fixed values. Users now receive meaningful risk assessments that help them make informed decisions about AI model safety.
